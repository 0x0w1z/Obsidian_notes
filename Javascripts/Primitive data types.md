```
1. Strings : "Hello world" 
2. Numbers : 1,2,3,4,5
3. Boolean : True , False
4. Null : let a = null
5. Undefined : let a
```



**NULL is the thing which is not defined by itself rather than that you have to assign that yourself**  

```
let loggedUser = null

loggedUser = kirito
```

**UNDEFINED is what it exist but it doesn't have the values of it**

```
let pokemon;
console.log(pokemon)
// undefined 
```
